Maintainer tools
===

These are the internal-ish Readability2 tools.
They are not very user-friendly. This is by design.

| File | Purpose
| --- | ---
| `build.py` | Build the `readability2.min.js` package
| `cli.js` | Convert an HTML file to plain text
| `compare.js` | Run readability2 and compare the result with the reference
| `debug.js` | Visual debugger
| `getpage.py` | Save a web page to the test_pages folder
| `repair.js` | Repair an HTML file using parse5
| `report.js` | Regression testing breakdown
| `runtests.js` | Run the regression testing
